<div align="left" style="padding-left:3%; padding-right:3%;">
<li align="justify">As a principle, RADION collects only what we need and will not share your personal information with any third parties other than our identity verification partner. Even within RADION, access to your personal information is limited to a subset of employees who work on compliance and identity verification matters. RADION is the only data controller and processor.</li>
<li align="justify">You will provide to us, immediately upon our notice of request, information that we, in our sole discretion, deem to be required to maintain compliance with any international, federal, state or local law, regulation or policy. Such documents may include, but are not limited to, passports, driver’s licenses, utility bills, photographs of you, government identification cards, or sworn statements.</li>
<li align="justify">RADION reserves its right to request documentation, described in paragraph 19(A), prior to activating your account at any of the Services, and any services, available through website. RADION may refuse you access to the Services and website should it have doubts as to validity, authenticity and genuineness of the documents, provided by you.</li>
<li align="justify">RADION collects information from running the website and products, provided thereto, and uses information, provided to us by you. When you visit the website or use our products, we collect information sent to us by your computer, mobile phone, or other access device. This information may include your IP address, device information including, but not limited to, identifier, name, and type, operating system, mobile network information and standard web log information, such as your browser type, and the pages you accessed on our website.

Before permitting you to use our website and products, we may require you to provide additional information (such as a date of birth, passport number, numbers that you may use or have registered with your local tax authority, or other data which can be used for personal identification purposes and that may be required to comply with applicable laws) so that we can verify your identity or address. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification services.</li>
<li align="justify">When you use our website, we collect information about your transactions (such as date, time and amount of transaction) and your other activities on our website and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes.

<li align="justify">Throughout these Terms, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person.

<li align="justify">We store and process your personal information on our servers. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration.

We also authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</li>
<li align="justify">We are sometimes required to compare the personal information you provide to third party databases in order to verify its accuracy and confirm your identity. This allows us to comply with state and federal anti-money laundering and “know your customer” regulations. We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
